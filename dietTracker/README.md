# How to Use Excel Diet Tracker Sample API


1.	Make sure you have a recent dogfood build of Excel 16 Preview installed (14.0.4229.1002).
2.  Download DemoAppManifest.xml and save it in your app catalog or a shared folder. To add a shared location or app catalog, you can do so by going to the backstage -> Options -> Trust Center -> Trust Center Settings… -> Trusted App Catalogs and adding https://msft.spoppe.com/sites/appcatalog as a “Catalog Url” or the path to your shared folder as "Trusted Locations" and then checking the “Show in Menu” box.  
2.	Open a workbook in Excel 16.
3.	Insert -> My Apps -> My Organization -> Diet Tracker Sample App (if you don’t see “My Organization” or “Shared ”, make sure they are trusted and "Show in Menu" is checked )
4.	You can try out the app by clicking the buttons in order.

You can see the source code in my Github Repo and feel free to make a pull request and help make this demo better!


Thanks and happy dogfooding Excel APIs!
